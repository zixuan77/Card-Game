# Card-Game

The goal for this lab is to write a program that will manage cards for a card game. All cards have a suit and a rank, which can be used to determine the value of cards in relation to each other. All cards will be managed by a Binary Search Tree (BST) where the best card is the maximum and the worst card is the minimum.
In order to manage cards for this lab, you will define a Card and PlayerHand classes that organizes the cards in a BST data structure.


Card.py - Defines a Card class. For simplicity, this class will assume all Cards have a suit and a rank

PlayerHand.py - Defines a PlayerHand (BST) class that is an ordered collection of a Playerâ€™s Cards. You can adapt the BST implementation shown in the textbook supporting the specifications in this lab

testFile.py - This file will contain your pytest functions that tests the overall correctness of your class definitions
